### Goals and Motivation: 

The goal of our project is to make it easy for everybody and anybody to mint NFTs.
There are a lot of people that wants to get their hands on this NFT field but due to the complexity of the process, they donâ€™t really end up minting their own NFTs
Our project aims to target that field of users and make it as easy as possible for anyone to mint their NFT.
